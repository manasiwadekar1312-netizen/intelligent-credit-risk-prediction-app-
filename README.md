# Loan Risk Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project developed using Python to predict whether a loan application will be Approved or Rejected based on applicant financial and personal details.

The project covers the full data analytics and machine learning lifecycle including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a web application.
